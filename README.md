# distributed-ensemble-project

All of the GENI machines have the same Github repository on them, with code separated into folders.
Note that within "classifier/images/" there are 1,000 CIFAR-10 images so it will take a few moments to download.
In the central repository we can put any other utilities, like maybe to translate between integer predictions and names?

Here are some things that need done.
* Implementation
  1. Test our ability to run multiple experiments automatically.
  3. Do we want to submit a simplified version that excludes the ability to rerun experiments?
* Report
  1. Final proof-reading
  2. Add screenshots to usage instructions
* Supplementary Materials, incl. stuff for report
  1. Video demo
  2. Rspec (put on github)
  3. Screenshots to show how it works
  4. Scripts to wget everything. But make them install it, if that's easier for us.
  5. Instructions for running an experiment.

Here are things we've put on the list that have been finished:
1. Adding FSMs
2. Adding explicit learning outcomes.
2. Write code to generate plots.
